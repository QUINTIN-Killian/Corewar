# Corewar project
Repository for the EPITECH Corewar project.

## Rules :
#### Commits standard :
["ADD"/"FIX"/"FEAT"/"DEL"/"TEST"/"..."] "description" (ex : [FIX] coding style)
#### Branches :
- We don't code on the 'main' branch
- We don't code on the 'dev' branch
- We create branches with the following name pattern : "ACTION"/"name" (ex : FEAT/right_redirections)
- We merge our branches on the 'dev' branch and merge 'dev' on 'main' with the agreement of everybody
